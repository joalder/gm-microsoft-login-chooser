# Microsoft Login Auto Clicker
Automatically chooses the only available Microsoft account on login. If multiple are available, prefers the one with 'Admin' in its name.

Intended for usecases where you typically only have one Microsoft login active per context or alternatively have additional ones injected from OS.

Works well if different accounts are separated by [Firefox Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/)
